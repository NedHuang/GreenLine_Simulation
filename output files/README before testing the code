# GreenLineSimulation
Discrete event simulation of the Minneapolis Green Line project made by 
Mingzhe Huang, 4944090 and Yiding Weng, 4464621
How to compile:
    ./compile.sh
How to test:
    ./test.sh <num of trains> <num of train cars> <inter-arrival time>
such as:
    ./test.sh 20 3 30


After type test.sh, vim will open output file. You can browse output contents by click j, k, h, l. The output file will be renewed for each run. 
If you does not like open with vim, you can change the last line in "test.sh".
The possible editor is emacs, cat, more, less

The write-up is available in both PDF and doc. If it is possible please judge the word version. Some data in the table cannot be shown in PDF. Sorry about the inconvenience. 
There is another excel file creates tables and graphs for analyzing the data. The number of average passenger waiting on platform is rounded to integer.

All raw output data for each simulation are saved in name of
 “num of train” “num of cars” “inter-arrival rate”

The information of each passenger could also be checked in these file. But it is not concluded in write-up report.

Thanks

Mingzhe Huang and Yiding Weng
